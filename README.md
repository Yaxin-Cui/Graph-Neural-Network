# Graph Neural Network based Network Competition Analysis

## General information
- This is the anomalized data and the key part of the codes for link prediction for product competition network data using Graph Neural Networks (GraphSAGE) method. 
- The code and data are assiocated with paper Product Competition Prediction in Engineering Design using Graph Neural Networks. Experiment code associated with the paper: A Graph Neural Network Approach for Product Relationship Prediction (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05881)
- link prediction for product competition network data using Graph Neural Networks (GraphSAGE) method
