# Graph Neural Network based Network Competition Analysis

## General information
- This is the anomalized data and the key part of the codes for link prediction for product competition network data using Graph Neural Networks (GraphSAGE) method. 
- The code and data are assiocated with paper Product Competition Prediction in Engineering Design using Graph Neural Networks.
